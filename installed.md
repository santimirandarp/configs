* Lynx & w3m: console browsers
* pandoc: convert files to different formats
* Servers: vsftp, isc-dhcp-server, sama
* netplan: configure network interface
* htop: process viewer
* mpv: Console media player
* wmctrl: issuing `wmctrl -m` tells you which window manager you're using in a nice format.
* vim & nvim: text editors. Alias nvim to vim, it has more features.
* youtube or spotify dl download stuff. Actually, spotify_dl also downloads from youtube.
* spotify cli is for listening content
* git descentralized version control
* tmux allows to split terminal, and easily switch between panels. It may not be necessary when using awesome in tiling mode, but it has some great features.
* awesome and openbox. favourite WMs. 
Had problems with the power so I download many apps to test and see what they offer, also some random powerlines XD:
```
sudo apt-get install powerdebug power-calibrate powerline powerlint-doc powerline-gitstatus powermanagement-interface powerstat
```
## not in the official repositories
* VSCode and extensions: ESLint, Jest, Prettier, Liveserver, Document This,...
* Mozilla VPN
